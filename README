Setup Notes:
	Set DTG settings to zcu100-revc
	Set u-boot config target to xilinx_zynqmp_zcu100_revC_defconfig
	Set yocto name to ultra96-zynqmp
	Set Root filesystem type to SD card
	Keep kernel defaults
	Add desired packages to petalinux-image-full.bbappend
	Enable packages in rootfs_config

PetaLinux 2018.3 Bugs:
	mipi-support-ultra96 is forcefully included and references a non-existent clock
	remove it by renaming the original mipi-support-ultra96.dtsi files for backup
	then create stub files

	rootfs Kconfigs are way too lacking and may need to be supplemented by bbappends
	old documentation says "petalinux-image.bbappend"
	but "petalinux-image-full.bbappend" seems to be the correct one as of 2018.3?

	An fbdev provides libgbm symlinked to libMali, but it is not built with libgbm support, must use wayland version for GBM
	

Other Notes:
	vim-tiny is in the added package list because vim depends on X11 for whatever reason

	The Mali driver is very picky regarding surface formats
	Apparently XRGB8888 and/or 24/32-bit color are not supported
	Must use RGB565 and/or 16/16-bit color

	petalinux-features.conf is included after petalinuxbsp.conf
	petalinux-features.conf sets mraa's and upm's bindings to depend on nodejs
	To prevent this, set the binding variables in petalinuxbsp.conf
	and add a _forcevariable = "1" for each of the binding variables
